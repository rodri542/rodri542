## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **final-year Computer Systems Engineering student** at Instituto Tecnológico de Morelia, passionate about technology and its power to solve real-world problems.

I enjoy working in collaborative environments, where I can learn from others and contribute with my own knowledge and ideas.
I'm a social person who loves to connect, share, and grow with a team. Aside from tech, I also enjoy going to the **gym** and maintaining a healthy, balanced lifestyle.

🌟 **Looking to make an impact in a top tech company where I can bring my skills to life!** 🌟
